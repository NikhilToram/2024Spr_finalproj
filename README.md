# Dot and Boxes a Strategic version
## Members: Veera Toram and Tali Zacks

For our version of the game Dots and Boxes, we will make an irregular grid pattern that has a multiplicity of repeating and non-repeating shapes with varying points {based on the size of the shape captured. Another unique aspect of this game would be that if a player captured the majority of a repeating shape they win all of the equivalent shapes.

We are open to evaluating and testing various algorithms based on the final size of the puzzle, but we do think a minimax-based algorithm and alpha-beta pruning and/or localized gameplays based on the unique shape would be a good fit. We intend to utilize the features of Network X for this project.
